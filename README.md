If you follow these steps it might work:

step 1: download the files.

step 2: drag the chaos mod file in the teardown mod folder.
 
step 3: drag the other file anywhere you like (i think).

step 4: you have to open the file with text editor or every other editor you like (not Paint3D).

step 5: you have to change the USERNAME to your channel name.

step 6: you have to change the TOKEN to your twitch token (instructions in the file or at the almost buttom of the readme file).

step 7: you have to change the CHANNEL to your your channel name (basiclly the same as your username for me).

step 8: you have to change the path to mod to the path where the chaos mod is located`(for me its C:my user\\Documents\\Teardown\\mods\\Chaos Mod Copy ) !!!! make sure to use double \\ `

step 9: Run the script in you fav code editor and make sure you have all add ons installed then enable the mod and have fun
 
 
To obtain your Twitch channel token, you can follow these steps:
 
 
Go to the Twitch website (https://www.twitch.tv/) and log in to your Twitch account.

Once logged in, click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the screen.

From the dropdown menu, select "Creator Dashboard."

In the Creator Dashboard, click on the "Settings" tab on the left sidebar.

Under the "Settings" tab, click on "Stream."

Scroll down to the "Stream Key & Preferences" section.

In the "Primary Stream Key" section, you will find your channel token. It is a unique alphanumeric string.

Please note that your channel token is sensitive information that grants access to your Twitch channel. Keep it secure and avoid sharing it with others. If you suspect that your token has been compromised, 

it is recommended to regenerate a new token for security purposes.
